# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.10.0] - 2016-11-25
### Added
- Added support for 3scale extensions (experimental or non-standard
  features that are not part of the official API). You just need to
  add the `:extensions` symbol and the value to the hash of options that
  the client methods accept. The value is itself a hash containing the
  parameter names as keys and the parameter values as values.

## [2.9.0] - 2016-10-21
This version drops support for Ruby versions < 2.1 and JRuby < 9.1.1.0.

### Added
- Added method `ThreeScale::Client::AuthorizeResponse#limits_exceeded?`
  to check whether an authorization is denied and is so because at least
  one metric went over the limits.

## [2.8.2] - 2016-10-18
### Added
- Added support for retrieving metric hierarchies in authorize calls.
  This is an experimental feature and its support is not guaranteed for
  future releases.

## [2.8.1] - 2016-10-11
### Changed
- Improved parsing performance of the response of the authorize call.

## [2.8.0] - 2016-09-06
This version drops support for Ruby versions < 2.0.

### Added
- Added support for reporting to services other than the default one.
  `ThreeScale::Client#report` now accepts an optional `service_id`.
  There has been a change in the params that the method accepts. This
  change is backwards compatible but a deprecation warning is shown
  when calling the method using the old params.
- The two authorize calls `ThreeScale::Client#Authorize` and
  `ThreeScale::Client#oauth_authorize` now accept an optional predicted
  usage parameter.
- It is now possible to specify a port different that the default
  one for the API service management endpoint.
